# The original problem is about a bus collecting blood donations in a single institution (a university). Working with 748 donor data points, the researchers were able to build a RFMTC model that predicted wether or not a individual would donate blood on the next visit to the university with 0.79% accuracy.

# DataCamp used the case above to develop a project exercise to it's students. The project begins with some data exploratory analysis and ends with the model building.

# The repository at hand continues that project by providing an API to be consumed on other applications. This API is hosted on my local machine, but the next step is to host it on cloud.

# Blood Donations Predictor API.

## The original problem is about a bus collecting blood donations in a single institution (a university). Working with 748 donor data points, the researchers were able to build a RFMTC model that predicted wether or not a individual would donate blood on the next visit to the university with 0.79% accuracy.

## DataCamp used the case above to develop a project exercise to it's students. The project begins with some data exploratory analysis and ends with the model building with Machine Learning techniques.

## The repository at hand continues that project by providing an API to be consumed on other applications. It also provides a web application to test the API.

## This API is hosted on my local machine, but the next step is to host it on cloud.
